We're continuing our journey as beginner web developers.  

In this lesson, you will learn how to:  
- Use **Express.js** in your applications and understand why it's such a valuable tool.
- Handle requests with arguments and make your backend more interactive.
- Run an already-built frontend alongside your backend for a better experience.


### Why do we need Express.js?
In the previous lesson, while adding support for the `/sum` route, we noticed that although it wasn't particularly hard, the process was cumbersome.  
For example, if you were to support five similar routes the same way, your code would quickly become messyâ€”filled with a long chain of `if-else` statements in a single file. 
That's why this approach isn't used in real-world projects.  

<div style="text-align: center; max-width:200px; margin: 0 auto; ">
<img src="images/express.svg">
</div>

A fast and easy way to streamline your work in Node.js is _[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)_.
Express.js is a framework designed to simplify the process of building web servers and APIs.
It provides tools and features to handle HTTP routes, middleware, request/response handling, and more.
With Express.js, you can quickly create robust web applications while avoiding unnecessary boilerplate code.

### Backend folder
You may have noticed that a **backend** directory has appeared in your project structure. 
This will come in handy at the end of this lesson.
