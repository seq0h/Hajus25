We've decided to implement our data layer in the simplest way â€“ by storing data in memory using JavaScript data structures.

The implementation of our data layer can be found in the file `backend/src/data/dataServices.js`. Take a moment to review it carefully.

The file includes a `store` object that acts as our storage and a `userService` object that provides an interface for working with users.

For now, we only need two methods: one for creating a user and one for finding an existing user.
We will store user information in a `Map` data structure, where the username is the key, and the value is an object containing the username and password.
The `createUser` method has already been implemented for you.


<div class="hint" title="Map data structure">

  You can refresh your knowledge about the `Map` data structure and its methods in [this documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).
</div>

<div class="hint" title="Hashed passwords">

  Cryptography is a complex topic that deserves its own course. 
  We won't focus on it now, but note that sensitive data like passwords should never be stored as plain text.
  Later, we will use a [cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) for password encryption.
  Now let's just note that the `createUser` method already accepts hashed password.
</div>

### Task
Implement the `getUser` method so that:
- If the user exists in `store.users`, return an object with two fields: `username` and `password`.
- If the user doesn't exist, return `undefined`.

Remember that you can use the tests in the file `backend/__tests__/dataServices.test.js` for self-checking.
