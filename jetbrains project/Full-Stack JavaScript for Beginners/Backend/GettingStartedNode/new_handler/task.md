It's time for some practice! Let's do a quick warm-up and make sure we are on the same page.

Currently, the backend responds with `Hello, World!` when a request is made to the `/` route, and `Page Not Found` for all other routes.

### Task
Add one more route: `/sum`. For now, this route should simply return the text `'TODO in the next lesson'` with a status code of `501`. 
This status code means [Not Implemented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/501), which is perfectly suitable in this case.

Later on, we will work with this route differently, but for now, let's start with this initial setup.

<div style="text-align: center; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">

</div>

Press the `Check` button below this text to verify your solution with our automatic testing system.
However, you can also check how your program works using the steps shown in the [Hello world](course://Backend/GettingStartedNode/hello_world) task.
