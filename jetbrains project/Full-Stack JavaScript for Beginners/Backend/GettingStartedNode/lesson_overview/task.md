### About Node.js
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code.
Although JavaScript is typically used for front-end development, 
Node.js makes it possible to write both client-side and server-side code using the same language.

Node.js is fast, beginner-friendly, and gives developers access to an extensive package ecosystem called [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager).
NPM provides countless reusable components for various tasks, saving time and effort during development.

Node.js uses an event-driven, asynchronous architecture. 
This means the system reacts to events (like incoming requests or user actions)
as they occur, rather than waiting for tasks to finish. 
This prevents delays and makes Node.js a good choice for real-time applications.
