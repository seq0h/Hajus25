Our app already looks quite good, but to make it even better,
we will add real-time message sending and receiving functionality.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

We will use the [socket.io-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-client) library to manage WebSockets.
The implementation will be even simpler than what we did on the backend.
