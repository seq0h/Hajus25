In this lesson, you will learn:
- The structure of a React projectâ€™s file system.
- How to create and run a simple React application.

### Frontend file structure
In the task folder, you 'll find the `frontend` directory. For this lesson, we won't even need a backend.

```text
frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.js
â””â”€â”€ src/
 Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.jsx
 Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx
 Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.css
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ assets/
 Â Â   Â Â  â””â”€â”€ academy.svg
```

We recommend exploring each file briefly to familiarize yourself with the structure, which will make things easier as you move forward. 
The purpose of these files is as follows:
- `index.html`: The main HTML template for the application, linking to the root React component and setting up the initial page.
- `package.json`: The configuration file for the project.
- `vite.config.js`: The configuration file for Vite, specifying build and development server settings.
- `src/main.jsx`: The entry point of the React application, rendering the root React component (`App`) into the HTML.
- `src/App.jsx`: The main React component of the application.
- `src/index.css`: The main CSS file providing the application's styling and visual design.
- `src/assets/academy.svg`: A [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) for the application.

Most of the changes in this lesson will be made in the `src/App.jsx` file.
We'll talk about it in more detail later.

### Running the project
To run this application, open the `frontend/package.json` file and click ![](images/run.svg) next to the `start` script in the IDE interface.

You will see an output similar to this:
<div style="text-align: center; width:60%; max-width: 500px;">
<img src="images/vite_start_log.png">
</div>

Click the displayed URL (http://localhost:3000/) to see the `Welcome!` message in your browser!

ðŸŽ‰ Yay, you've launched your first frontend application.

### Stopping the project
Remember to always stop your application when you're done. Click the ![](images/stop.svg) button in the tool window at the bottom of your IDE.

### Making changes
Try modifying the `frontend/src/App.jsx` file: change the text,
add another header, and see how the changes you make are reflected in the browser.

<style>
img {
  display: inline !important;
}
</style>
