We've already had some practice with React, so now it's time to get started on our project:
specifically, setting up interaction with the backend.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:
- Communicate with the backend using a REST API.
- Handle authentication tokens on the frontend.

### Project structure
Next in the course, you will encounter the familiar project structure from the backend part of the course:
```text
.
├── backend/ 
├── frontend/
└── package.json  // project configuration file
```

### Backend API
To remind yourself about the backend API, take a look at the [Backend connection](course://Frontend/Introduction/backend_connection) task described in the Introduction lesson.
Feel free to look into the backend source code if you need it.
