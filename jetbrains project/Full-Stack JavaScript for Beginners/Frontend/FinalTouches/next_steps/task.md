That's it!

You now have enough knowledge to start your journey in full-stack JS development.
While the tasks in this section are complete, there's always room to enhance and refine your project.

Here are a few ideas to get you started:
- Add a link to the registration page from the login page, and vice versa. For example: 
  ```jsx
    <p className="form-footer">
      Don't have an account? <Link to="/register">Register here</Link>
    </p>
  ```
- Use different background colors for user messages and messages from others.
- Automatically scroll to the bottom when new messages arrive.
- Add a feature to edit messages.
- Create public and private chat rooms.
- Add a light/dark mode toggle.
- And much more!
