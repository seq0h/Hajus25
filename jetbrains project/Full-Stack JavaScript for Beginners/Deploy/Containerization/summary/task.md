Letâ€™s summarize briefly. To deploy your application using Docker, you need:

1. A Dockerfile where you define the environment for your service, install dependencies, and configure the application build process.
2. A Compose file where you describe how your services should run, what data should be stored in persistent storage, which ports to expose, and other configurations.
3. A `.env` file to store secret keys. Avoid committing this file to the repository, and never set sensitive environment variables directly in the Dockerfile or Compose file.

Now you can deploy your application to any server with almost a single command.

Good luck!
